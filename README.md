***

## Getting Started

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository**</ins>

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/LaneCeea/Snake`.

<ins>**2. Generating workspace with premake**</ins>

Run the [Setup-Windows.bat](https://github.com/LaneCeea/Snake/blob/master/scripts/Setup-Windows.bat) file found in `scripts` folder, which will generate a Visual Studio solution file `Snake.sln` in the root directory. Open it, then you are free to develop.

***

## Development
If there is any source file added or removed, modify the coresponding `premake5.lua` file of the project, and then run the [Rebuild-Windows.bat](https://github.com/LaneCeea/Snake/blob/master/scripts/Rebuild-Windows.bat) file found in `scripts` folder. Or just ask Lan for safety.

Snake is a game currently under development for Windows/MSVC.

***

## Getting Started

We need to use git command when developing the project, so go download [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if you haven't.

<ins>**1. Downloading the repository**</ins>

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/LaneCeea/Snake`. This will clone the github project into your local computer.

<ins>**2. Generating workspace with premake**</ins>

Run the `Setup-Windows.bat` file found in `scripts` folder. This will generate a Visual Studio solution file `Snake.sln` in the root directory. Open it, then you are free to develop.

***

## Development
If there is any modification to `premake5.lua`, run the `Rebuild-Windows.bat` file found in `scripts` folder to re-generate the workspace. Or just ask me for safety.
